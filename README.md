## Data Miner

### Description
This script extracts specific information from websites using the `Playwright` library and saves it into an Excel file. It's ideal for scraping data such as product names and prices from e-commerce platforms.

### Features
- Scrapes data based on provided CSS class names.
- Automatically waits for elements to load.
- Saves the extracted data in an Excel file.
- Includes the domain name in the saved file for better organization.

### How to Use
1. Define the URL and the CSS class names of elements you want to scrape in the `urls` dictionary.
2. Run the script.
3. The scraped data will be saved in the `CBT-CIP/` directory as an Excel file named after the website domain.

### Example
For the URL `https://www.amazon.in`, the script extracts product titles and prices using the CSS class names `s-title-instructions-style` and `a-price-whole`.
